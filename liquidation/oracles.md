* fallback oracles deprecated and handed over to governance

**Defi Spartan(24/03/2022) - from discord**

* The Fallback Oracle doesn’t have any code, it’s just a contract that allows for the manual input of prices in the event of a complete Oracle failure that needs manual intervention.
* The fallback Oracle has never been used, and I’m honestly not sure what a use case for it would be given the redundancy of Chainlink oracles.\
